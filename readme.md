## About

Stblib is a HEADER ONLY library for modern C++.


The library has two purposes :

* Provide strong types to represent units, such as time, intensity, length, speed ... and allow easy calculation between them, taking uncertainties into account. Creating new units is easy.
* Provide a solid and accurate time management module. This module implements timers, countdowns and dates with relativity support and scalable time flow. The time module has an accuracy near to the nanosecond.

## Why do you need this library ?



## Get Library

Clone the latest revision :

    git clone http://bitbucket.org/stabaxltd/stblib.git

## Use library

Simply include the desired header files in your sources.
Look at the getting started related page to learn how to use the features.

/!\\ IMPORTANT NOTE : your compiler must support **c++14**.

## Fast examples

    #include "stblib/units/length.hh"
    #include "stblib/units/duration.hh"
    #include "stblib/units/speed.hh"
    #include <iostream>

    //a and b represent 3000 meters in different ways
    stb::millimeter<int> a(3000000);  //3000000 is handled by an integer
    stb::kilometer<float> b(3);       //3 is handled by a float

    stb::centimeterPerSecond<double> d = a / stb::second<int>(3);
    //OK, length/duration returns a speed.

    std::cout << d.count() << '\n';   //prints 100000

As you can you can see, every thinkable conversion are done implicitly.
Let's see how to use time module :

    #include "Timer.hh"
    #include "Date.hh"
    #include <iostream>

    //prints the current gmt hour
    std::cout << stb::Date::get(stb::Date::hour, stb::Date::gmt) << '\n';
    //prints the current month of your machine
    std::cout << stb::Date::get(stb::Date::month, stb::Date::local) << '\n';

    stb::Timer tim;
    tim.start();
    //prints the time elapsed since start() in nanoseconds
    std::cout << tim.get<stb::nanoseconds<long long>>() << '\n';
